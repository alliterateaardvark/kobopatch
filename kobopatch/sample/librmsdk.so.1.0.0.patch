#
### Enable this patch to avoid blank lines at the bottom of pages in ePub books.
#
# The default values of orphans:2; widows:2; cause extra blank lines to be added
# to some pages to avoid leaving isolated lines of a paragraph at the top or
# bottom of a page. Enabling this patch effectively forces orphans:1; widows:1;,
# overriding the defaults and the book's stylesheet.
#
# Beware that this patch might(?) intefere with related CSS properties such as
# page-break-after:avoid; or page-break-inside:avoid;. A better solution would
# be to edit the book's stylesheet to set orphans:1; widows:1;.
#
# (This patch was previously named `Fix page breaks bug`, but that bug [the long
# paragraph bug] was fixed in firmware version 3.5.0.)

# Multi-version patch: 3.3.0 - 4.8.10956+
#
## Kobo devices don't come with any monospace fonts. If the book's stylesheet
## specifies font-family:monospace; then the ePub reader will try to use the
## "Courier Std" font, but even if that font were installed it wouldn't work
## because the pathnames used by the ePub reader to request the font are wrong.
##
## This patch lets the EPUB reader use any font with a name beginning "Courier"
## (e.g. Courier Prime, available at http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime)
## as the default monospace font instead of just Adobe's Courier Std font, and
## also corrects the pathnames so that it can be found. If no suitably named
## font is installed then this patch will have no effect.
#
# To use a different font name, change "Courier" in the replacement string to
# another font name prefix (7 letters max.). For example, change
# `normal/Courier` to `normal/Dark`, `bold/Courier` to `bold/Dark`, etc. to
# use HP's Dark Courier font available at
# http://h20000.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?swItemId=lj611en
