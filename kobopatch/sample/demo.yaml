# The following patch is just to demonstrate the patch format.
#
# This patch format may seem more verbose, but I plan to make a shorthand version.
# This format comes with many benefits, for example:
# - Simpler and more predictable parsing
# - Easier to understand at first glance
# - More flexibility (many ways to represent numbers, can use any YAML feature)
# - Easier to reuse and extend
# - More complete error checking to prevent mistakes
# - Easier to add more complex instructions when needed
Demo Patch Name:
  - Enabled: false # This is a comment

  - PatchGroup: Group 1 # If set, kobopatch will make sure only 1 patch in a patch group is enabled
  
  - BaseAddress: 0x2A # Hex base address
  - BaseAddress: 42 # Int base address
  
  - FindBaseAddress: "test\0test\t\n\v\f\e\x23dfgdfg" # Demonstration of the escape codes
  
  - ReplaceString:
    Offset: 0x0 # You can also use a number
    Find: "asd"
    Replace: "fgh"

  # You can also write instructions in one line
  - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x0, Find: "asd", Replace: "fgh"}

  # NEW: The FindReplaceString function combines FindBaseAddress and ReplaceString.
  - FindReplaceString:
    Find: "asd" # This does FindBaseAddress and is also the Find for ReplaceString
    Replace: "fgh" # Must be the same length or shorter than Find just like in ReplaceString.
  
  - ReplaceInt:
    Offset: 0x0
    Find: 5 # You can also use a hex (with the prefix 0x)
    Replace: 10 # You can also use a hex (with the prefix 0x)
  
  - ReplaceInt: {Offset: 0x0, Find: 5, Replace: 10}

  - ReplaceFloat:
    Offset: 0x0
    Find: 1.23
    Replace: 4.56

  - ReplaceFloat: {Offset: 0x0, Find: 1.23, Replace: 4.56}
  
  - ReplaceBytes:
    Offset: 0x0
    Find: [0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC]
    Replace: [0xDD, 0xEE, 0xFF]

  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x0, Find: [0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC], Replace: [0xDD, 0xEE, 0xFF]}
